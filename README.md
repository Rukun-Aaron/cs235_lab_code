## Notes to the students

- Pull the latest updates before you come to the lab. It may take a while to download the updates.
- This repo will be updated weekly during Semester 2, 2022. You should pull the latest before you start working on the exercise.
- Each lab may contain multiple projects. In this case, each project should have its own virtual environment. When you open the project with VS Code or PyCharm, the project folder should be used as the root directory, not this repo.
- You cannot commit to this repo. If you want to upload your results to GitHub, use the `Fork` button, and then clone the forked repo from your account. 
- When you fork a repo, the forked repo under your account is the exact clone at the time you click the button. It will not receive update unless you manually click the `Merge` button from your GitHub page.
